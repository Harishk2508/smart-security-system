# smart-security-system
The smart security system project aims to create a reliable and efficient security solution using IoT (Internet of Things) technology. The system utilizes a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to detect motion, a GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) module to send SMS alerts, and an Arduino Uno microcontroller for processing and control.

The primary purpose of the project is to provide real-time monitoring of unauthorized movements in a specific area and alert the user via SMS. This system can be deployed in homes, offices, or any location where enhanced security is required.
